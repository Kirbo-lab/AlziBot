Botphyte also adds **a new mention**, `@random`, which pings a random member of the server!

## Hosting

This bot has channel IDs/user IDs hard-coded in, so you must host and customize the bot yourself.

You can follow the [hosting guide](https://https://github.com/WhosPix3l/Botphyte/wiki/Hosting) to properly install it! Don't worry, it's fast and simple if you follow the guide!
